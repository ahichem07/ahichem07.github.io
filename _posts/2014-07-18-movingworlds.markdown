description: 
Multiple contracted projects under the title of "Operations and Knowledge Manager", we achieved the following things -
- Analysing Business to Customer (B2C) sales data and presenting dashboards, providing insights
into the sales strategy cycle on cycle. This resulted in a 218% increase in applications for the
MovingWorlds Institute from 2019 to 2020.
- Working closely with the Corporate Programmes team to harvest data and prepare external facing
dashboards, in order to track Key Performance Indicators (KPIâ€™s) and programme impact. This
resulted in two high-profile publicly-listed corporate partners renewing existing contracts in 2021.
- Designing and implementing an internal Objective and Key Result (OKR) setting and monitoring
process, in close collaboration with the CEO. This resulted in the organisation being able to
self-track progress on key business areas.
- Successfully implementing Business Process Management (BPM) and Project Management (PM)
principles, using a Human Centered Design approach. This resulted in improved structure and
business framework, allowing the development of process improvements and effective project
management.
- Improving the efficiency of the MovingWorlds Institute application and Fellowship onboarding
process through the BPM cycle, supporting programme growth of 180% from 2019 to 2020.
- Researching new tools and methodologies for continuous improvement of business processes.
Supporting programme growth, specifically the implementation of a Learning Management System
in order to support the scalability of the MovingWorlds Institute.
